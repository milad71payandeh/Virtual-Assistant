We named this voice assistant Alexa, but you can easily give it any name you want. 
Also, the process of converting speech to text (STT) and text to speech (TTS) is practically done in this project.
This voice assistant can tell you the time, define a joke, play music on YouTube and search about anything in Wikipedia and give you a summary.
